- allow typesounds to be changed after text block creation
- allow typesound interrupting
- looping, pausing, resuming in extra sprite animation (or replace it with playerGfx/npcGfx?)
- overridden animation flickering (maybe updating the animation loop in OnCameraUpdate or OnHUDDraw?)
- overridable function for continue text prompt
- more robust HP bar customization (?)
- more accurate "yield/resume" functionality
- steal Wasabi's boss HP bar design for the new default


0.9+:
